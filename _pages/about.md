Behold! The School Newspaper Club has arrived, sent forth on a sacred mission to inform, inspire, and connect our school community, under the divine guidance of Holy Potato!

We are a devoted team of passionate writers, photographers, and creative thinkers, committed to bring you stories that matter. In each issue, we venture far and wide across the school to deliver a diverse range of content — from club spotlights and teacher insights to student trends and game reviews. If it’s part of our school community, you’ll find it here! Our mission is to produce genuine, heartfelt content that resonates with our readers, sparks interest, and builds connections.

Beyond reporting, we’re here to give you a voice. This paper is your platform to speak out, share your opinions, and promote your events. We need your voice here to bring this vision to life! So… Join us as we embark on this noble mission to capture the spirit of our school and share it with all!

## FUN FACT

You might have spotted our anime-styled mascot, Nyuus Chan (ニュースチャン). Get it? “Nyuus” sounds like “Nyaa” — a cute twist on “news”! For this year, a brand new mascot is in the works… Who will it be? Stay tuned to meet the next face of our School Newspaper Club!
