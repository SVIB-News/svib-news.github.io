## What is the charm of rhythm games?

I first got into rhythm games 5 years ago, the primary fun comes simply from moving your fingers on the screen by following the music, exploring different fingering techniques to pass high level songs. However, you really start to fall into it when you get perfect results after trying many times just to pass one song. The best part of the 3 years of playing Phigros is that it started to link with my social life. 

If I had a group of people playing with me, I could complain about the continuing failure of one single song or technique. We would share results and compliment others when they improved their skills. When we played together it was cool to exaggerate emotions with people around you, no matter what result you got. I still remember when my rks exceeded 15.5, many friends posted on the public wall of our school to celebrate that I was the 15th person that achieved that in our grade, and I saw other players congratulating me under the posts. That is the happiness I felt most when playing rhythm games, and I wish you could experience it too！

## Q&A

- **What games?** Needs to be mobile terminal. And it depends on the number of people playing the game, popular games will be considered first. (First game in my mind is phigros)
- **Competition rules?** Songs will be chosen due to difficulty, in every round, the people with least accuracy will be eliminated, the difficulty of the song will increase after every round.
- **Which songs will be chosen?** I would choose songs that test the most diverse skills, however if there are songs people really like, welcome to have a vote and add rounds for it!
