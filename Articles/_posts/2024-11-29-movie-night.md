On Friday, October the 18th, BINJ hosted a movie night and invited all students and teachers interested to join. Over 30 students participated and shared free snacks while enjoying the students-selected film “The Blind Side”, an inspiring movie based on the true story of Michael Oher, who underwent a metamorphosis from a homeless highschooler to a well-known football payer.

The student volunteers helped to build up a comfortable environment with bean bags and **FREEEEEE** snacks. Everyone was thrilled and enjoyed a wonderful two-hours movie time.  

We invited the student council president David Wang to reveal more details behind the scene of the activity. “The student council had brainstorm sessions at the start of the year,” says David. “Originally it was going to be on the field, but it was rainy on that day.” Despite the weather changes and other challenges, the student council worked hard to make sure this event was successful.

All participants gave positive feedback to our interviewers. “It was good to have such an opportunity to share this kind of experience with friends and classmates,” says a student, “I also like that they used curtains to block out the light.”

With this successful movie night, the BINJ student council looks forward to more upcoming on campus activities in the future.
