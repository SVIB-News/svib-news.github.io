Have you ever played Minecraft? Senior MC player must know, survival mode, which very challenging and playful, is the best mode forever. Today, I am going to recommend our *Foreign Survival Mode*. 

Ms. Sarah’s first impression of China dates back to 2010 when she participated in a student exchange program. She recalls her time in the bustling cities of Shanghai and Beijing with great enthusiasm. "I remember thinking that China was a vibrant and cool country," she says, highlighting her special fondness to the lively cityscape of Shanghai, which she found “colorful and loud, with a lot going on, especially for young people.”

Ms. Sarah’s Chinese learning journey start in 2016 when she was forming an internship. She did some one-on-one trainings with the teacher study from tones to complex sentences. She emphasizes the importance of professional tutor and suggest the person who is learning Chinese never shamed to ask 中文怎么说. “I think that cultural happiness about teaching foreigners the language really helped me to learn Chinese,” she says.

Besides, culture shock is an inevitable challenge. For Ms. Sarah, the Slurping of food will still bother her sometimes. Her way to adapt is to respect, “I found a better way to deal with it now and I know that it is a respectful thing in China to show that you are finding your food delicious and that you are enjoying it.”
Anyway, whatever in the game or the true life, well-adaption does not always mean that you must forget who you are and completely become a new person. The best way I think is always understanding and respecting.
