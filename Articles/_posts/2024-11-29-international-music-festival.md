With vibrant performances and workshops, The International Music festival, a cherished tradition in our school, once again concluded with a resounding success, thanks to the participation of students, parents, and faculties, especially Miss. Milanova. The event offered students a unique opportunity to connect with music and cultures across the world. As Milanova noted, “Through music and activities like this, students can learn so much about the world and its beauty, by being exposed to different cultures, people, rhythms, and music from all over the globe.” 

A highlight this year was a special performance by African drummers from Hong Kong. Miss Milanova shared, “This year, we had a very special feature we haven’t had before. We had guests from Hong Kong, the African drummers, who introduced us to West African culture.” As the videographer at the scene, the thunderous sound of the drums and the excitement it generated were especially memorable and impactful. In addition to performing, the drummers led workshops, teaching students the rhythms of the djembe drum and traditional African dance. “It was a real pleasure to see them perform on stage for both students and parents alike.”

The festival came with its usual challenges. “One challenge is the large number of students involved. We're talking about the whole high school, and sometimes our auditorium just isn’t big enough to accommodate all the guests we want to invite,” Miss Milanova explained. Nevertheless, the staff’s dedicated efforts ensured its smooth execution.
